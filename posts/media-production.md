Apart from coding, I have had a keen interest in media production side. It all started with my fascination about YouTube back in 2011. It was the time my mother bought the first ever smartphone in the family which was the Spice Coolpad (MI515) that came with 1GB Ram and 5MP Primary camera. It had YouTube installed and I was facinated by videos that people from all over the world had uploaded. I saw it as one big community uploading videos on diverse topics like tech, gardening and heck even how to shave videos. I remember watching [kipkay](https://www.youtube.com/@kipkay/featured) and [Hacktuber](https://www.youtube.com/@Hacktuber/featured) (formerly known as "American Hacker").

Keeping Hacktuber in mind, I started a YouTube channel back in 2016 and I named it **GameFanatics** where I uploaded hacking, rooting, patching, unboxing etc based videos. My main intention was not to gain views and subscribers. I just loved to see list of videos in my channel growing, thats all what I was uploading for. Then slowly and gradually I rebranded the channel and in current time it goes by the name **Avi deOry** ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@AVIdeOry/featured))

_No, theres no meaning behind it, I just randomly generated the name on internet and I found it cool_

(Reason of rebranding - GameFanatics domain was already owned by someone else).

From recording my computer screen with mobile phone camera to filling sand in frooti bottle (to make it heavy) and attaching a phone to it so that I can use it as tripod, to keeping earphones near by phone's mic to add music in my videos, I have done it all. Might be stupid ways but I was young and dumb myself.

I slowly started gaining an audience and recognition through the tech reviews I began uploading. Seeing this, my parents gifted me my first-ever proper camera, a Canon 200d. I learnt how to use it and shot many videos. As days passed, I mastered my shooting skills, and the quality of my videos started to improve significantly. I slowly got more interested in the cinematography field, and with each video I uploaded, my editing skills started improving significantly.

With a deep interest in both cinematic videos and technology, I embarked on a journey to create content that blended the best of both worlds. I started making tech videos infused with the essence of cinema, a creative fusion that allowed me to showcase technology in a visually captivating and compelling manner. By combining my passion for storytelling, cinematography, and tech expertise, I aspired to deliver content that not only informed but also inspired and entertained my audience. Through this unique approach, I aimed to create an immersive experience that would not only educate viewers about the latest tech trends but also evoke emotions and leave a lasting impact on their minds. As I continued to refine my craft, my videos began to resonate with a wider audience, and I found joy in knowing that my work was making a positive impact in the tech community and beyond.

As I continued creating tech videos, I also started having fun with a new interest: shooting short cinematic reels. These reels allowed me to be more creative and explore the world around me in a different way. I found great inspiration in the work of [JR Alli](https://www.youtube.com/@JRAlli), whose captivating cinematic reels left a profound impact on me. Witnessing his artistry and storytelling through visuals encouraged me to embark on my own journey into this realm of filmmaking.

These reels allowed me to be more creative and explore the world around me in a different way. Armed with my camera and equipment, I went out on spontaneous adventures, recording people, plants, and various scenes that caught my eye.

_This was shot and edited in roughly three days. I really loved making this video. When I see it today, I find a lot of mistakes and ways to improve, but for my younger self, I think it was nothing less than a masterpiece_

Unlike my structured tech videos, these cinematic reels were all about capturing the beauty of everyday life without following any strict rules or scripts. It was liberating to freely express my creativity and tell visual stories without limitations.

I wandered through busy streets, peaceful parks, and picturesque landscapes, aiming to showcase the beauty that often goes unnoticed. Each reel became a unique way to celebrate life's intricacies and share its wonders with others.

Through this artistic pursuit, I realized that cinematography was more than just techniqueâ€”it was a means of connecting with people, evoking emotions, and sharing meaningful narratives. These short cinematic reels became a joyful expression of my love for both media production and the magic of technology, reinforcing my passion for visual storytelling and its ability to touch hearts and minds.

I was 14-15 years old at this point, and during this time, I began collaborating with other YouTube tech channels, which proved to be a tremendous learning experience for me. As my skills and expertise grew, I started receiving inquiries from companies for tech reviews and cinematic ads. This marked the beginning of my journey as an earner in the field.

While YouTube didn't generate significant income, the collaboration with tech companies more than made up for it. I created videos for various renowned brands like Atomberg, Nitho, Skyvik, Mevofit, Koveru, Adcom, Desire Desire, Edifier, Mpow, Eksa, Leaf, Sensei Mods, Watchout Wearables and many other. However, it is worth mentioning that around 90% of these videos are now unlisted and not publicly available as of today (willing to show on request).
